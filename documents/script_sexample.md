1.) What made you go on your villain arc? My son ended his own life because some girl had falsely accused him and the entire city was sending him threats. She never had any proof, but because she was the daughter of a congressman, she didn't face any repercussions. I saw her on the day of the funeral, smiling and laughing with her friends like it was some type of joke. I knew that people like these will never face justice thanks to our wonderful legal system. So, I decided to find justice on my own. As a former police officer, I had some connections with the worst type of people. I called one of them on the phone and said, "Do you remember when I let your little brother off the hook? It's time to pay back that debt." He had seen the news, so he already knew what I wanted and wasted no time in saying yes. But that girl wouldn't regret her actions even if someone kidnapped her. So I took a different approach. Within 3 months, every single dirty deal that that congressman made was out in the public. The authorities didn't just take him into custody. They took all his property and assets as well. His wife and daughter were on the streets and went online to ask for sympathy. This is when I made my final move. Rumors about that girl falsely accusing and ruining the lives of several boys were spread everywhere. People hated her so much that they would drive by while throwing rocks at her head. And then one day, as she was crying on the sidewalk with her mother, I ran her....

2.) my Golden Child little sister tried to un alive me because I took away her Spotlight at my wedding so I put her in jail for a 12year sentence my little sister Ava has always been what someone would call a attention seeker she needs attention on her at all times and my parents didn't exactly help with humbling her every event had to be about her or she'd absolutely freak out at every single one of my birthday parties she'd blow out the candles and have her own presence and God forbid she had to watch someone else get something she didn't have I felt like I was invisible growing up because my parents hardly cared about my achievements or my events as they were always focused on the attention Ava deserved Ava was extremely premature and even died five times as a preey so my parents treat her like a little angel because they almost lost her so whenever Ava acted up they turned a blind eye Ava even had a nasty habit of trying to take the attention of anyone who tried to even look in my direction every single boy I've dated suddenly ghosted me and started showing up at our house asking for Ava I was sick of it so when I was 18 I distanced myself and went to a college out of state I found the love of my life Kyle there now 6 years later we're getting married his family became mine and I finally felt accepted somewhere so when it was time to compile the guest list I decided that it was time to see my family again so that they'd see what they were missing out on Kyle Even insisted I invite Ava because he wanted to be the one to finally put her in his place it it was the perfect day I walked down the aisle saw Ava huffing in the third row with my parents trying to calm her down and met Kyle at the end we both were in tears by the end of the ceremony and when it was time for reception I thought everything went exactly to plan that's when Ava struck she came up to me and in the most sincere Tone ever she congratulated me my jaw literally dropped that's when she offered me a glass of whiskey and made a toast to her beautiful sister and her handsome groom I was a little sused out because she had never been this nice to me before and that's when I went to drink the glass it smelled a little weird but I always get a little sick from alcohol so I drank up I started to feel a little woozy and felt my throat closing up it should be known that I have a severe allergy to lemons I looked at Ava and she held up a lemon in her hand I started panicking and holding on to my throat and Ava just walked away to Kyle she even twirled her hair at Kyle while I was literally dying Kyle looked my way as soon as she came to him and ran to me with an epip pen I had to go to the hospital because my throat was extremely damaged and had to miss my honeymoon so when the cops came to my room asking me what happened I told them exactly what happened Ava poisoned me you should have seen the way my phone blew up after Ava got arrested my parents were calling me a monster for turning on my own blood Ava even decided to get one of my exes to be her lawyer and all he could say during court was that I was a jealous liar the trial was obviously pretty short guess who going to jail for 12 years Ava...

5.) what's something you were told as a kid that turned out to be a horrible lie I was always told that my older brother ran away with his friends but it never really made sense because I still saw his friends around town I remember the first time I heard about him running away it was around 1987 and I was about 8 years old my father told me over dinner that my brother had left home while I was away at school that day and told me not to look for him I felt really sad because I really loved watching television with him and riding our bikes together and for him to leave without saying goodbye it really hurt my heart while I rolled around the peas with my Fork I asked my dad when my brother would be coming back my dad's expression turned Grim as he told me that my brother would most likely never return that broke my heart even more the following day I saw my dad cutting down my brother's favorite tree in the backyard I tried to run out and stop him but my dad told me that he needed to remove the tree so that he could send it to my brother that was another thing that never made sense to me but I accepted it as a kid days turned into weeks and weeks into years it had been 10 years since my older brother ran away I was ready to finally accept the fact that I would never see him again until I saw his best friend enter the grocery store I worked at and saw my chance at closure I approached him casually and asked if my brother lived with him or contacted him the friend gave a weirded out look and explained that none of my friends had seen him for over a decade I asked if they knew where my brother had run off to and they said that he never ran off anywhere I tried to push for more information but my father walked into the store looking for me I apologized to the friend and walked off to help my dad out later that night I looked around my brother's old room for more information and unfortunately found nothing after giving up I returned to my room and looked through our old drawing book we worked on together reminding myself of why I loved my brother so much growing up to my surprise two of the pages in the book had tiny folded notes addressed to me saying terrible things about my dad each note explained gruesome details about how my dad hit my brother or punished him through starvation or tied him up outside to a tree I covered my mouth from shock and frantically searched around my room for more clues from our old toys the last note I found asked me to call the police because he thought that my dad was going to do something unspeakable to him soon my heart raced just thinking about what had actually happened to my brother I brought all of the notes I found to class the following day and stopped by the police station in my free time I begged them to reopen my brother's case and submitted all the evidence as well as my personal testimony I asked them to bring in my brother's old friends who were also aware of the things that had been going on between my my brother and my father with enough statements the police escorted me home and arrested my father the moment he got home at the station it was revealed that my dad had really beaten my brother and hid him in the tree the week he went missing my father made sure to remove all notes from my brother's room but never bothered checking mine hearing his confession at the station made me sick to my stomach I couldn't believe I was living with a man who could hurt a family member in the most horrific ways imaginable I moved out of the house that same day and moved into my mom's house this year my dad has a chance for parole but I plan on fighting it for both me and my older brother...
