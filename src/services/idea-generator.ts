Based on the viral story analysis above, generate {count} completely NEW and original story ideas that follow these proven viral patterns. Each story should be:

1. EMOTIONALLY GRIPPING: Strong emotional hooks that trigger immediate engagement
2. MORALLY COMPLEX: Situations where right/wrong isn't black and white
3. RELATABLE: Universal themes people can connect with
4. SATISFYING: Clear resolution where justice/karma is served
5. SHOCKING: Unexpected twists that keep viewers engaged
6. AUTHENTIC: Written in natural, conversational first-person style

For each story idea, provide:
- Title: Compelling hook question or statement
- Hook: Opening line that grabs attention immediately  
- Story: 2-3 sentence summary of the full narrative arc
- Viral Factors: Specific elements that make this story shareable
- Estimated Views: Realistic projection based on similar content
- Emotional Triggers: Primary emotions this story evokes
- Target Audience: Demographics most likely to engage

IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:
- Stories must be original, not variations of the examples
- Include diverse themes: workplace, relationships, family, school, legal, etc.
- Mix different emotional tones: revenge, justice, standing up, exposing truth
- Ensure each story has a clear "villain" and satisfying consequence
- Make protagonists relatable but morally interesting
- Include specific, vivid details that make stories feel real
- End with resolution that feels justified and satisfying

Generate stories with {tone} tone, {length} length preference.

Return ONLY a valid JSON array of objects with this exact structure:
[
  {
    "title": "Story title here",
    "hook": "Opening hook line",
    "story": "2-3 sentence story summary",
    "viralFactors": ["factor1", "factor2", "factor3"],
    "estimatedViews": "X.XM views",
